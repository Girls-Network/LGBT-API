Genderfae (or genderdoe) is a form of genderfluidity that fluctuates between any range of feminine, neutral, or non-binary genders, but never encompasses masculine, male-aligned, or man-aligned genders. It falls under the genderfluid umbrella and represents a gender experience that is never 100% male.
